Under each directory you will find a README.md explaining the example.

Note that I have attempted to mark all commands in the terminal within \` \` marks, so commands will look `like this`. Generally, you will be running these commands in a terminal on your VM.  Output from the terminal is usually formatted like this:
```
[jschmersal1@WFIL011 infrastructure-docker-basics]$ docker images
REPOSITORY            TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
postgres              latest              4b52913b0a3a        4 days ago          313MB
concourse/concourse   latest              a1e690d81652        11 days ago         968MB
httpd                 2.4                 ccbcea8a6757        6 weeks ago         166MB
training/webapp       latest              6fae60ef3446        5 years ago         349MB
training/postgres     latest              6fa973bb3c26        6 years ago         365MB
```

In the above output, `[jschmersal1@WFIL011 infrastructure-docker-basics]$` is the terminal prompt, `docker images` is the command I ran, and the lines following the command are what was output to the terminal.
